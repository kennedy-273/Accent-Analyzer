# Deployment Instructions

Easily deploy the English Accent Analyzer to Streamlit Cloud for public access and testing.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The project code pushed to a GitHub repository
- A Streamlit Cloud account (the free tier is sufficient)

## 1. Prepare Your Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Push your project files to the repository, including:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`
   - Any other necessary files

## 2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Visit [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click **"New app"**.
3. Select your repository, choose the branch (usually `main`), and set the main file path to `app.py`.
4. Click **"Deploy"**.
5. Wait for the deployment to finish. Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies and launch your app.

## 3. App Configuration (Optional)

If your app needs environment variables or special settings:

1. Open your app's settings in Streamlit Cloud.
2. Add any required environment variables.
3. Adjust resource limits if necessary.

## 4. Share Your App

After deployment, you'll receive a public URL (e.g., `https://accent-analyzer-j6grkhdz4igjatn4qu9tj8.streamlit.app/`).  
Share this link with anyone who needs to use the app.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

- Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud for error messages.
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Confirm there are no syntax or runtime errors in your code.
- Make sure your repository is public or properly connected to Streamlit Cloud.

## Local Testing Before Deployment

It's best to test your app locally before deploying:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This helps catch issues early and ensures a smooth deployment.

## Updating Your App

To update your deployed app:

1. Commit and push changes to your GitHub repository.
2. Streamlit Cloud will automatically detect changes and redeploy your app.
