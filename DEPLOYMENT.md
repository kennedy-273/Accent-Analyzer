# Deployment Instructions

This document outlines how to deploy the English Accent Analyzer to Streamlit Cloud for easy access and testing.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. The code pushed to a GitHub repository
3. A Streamlit Cloud account (free tier is sufficient)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Push your code to the repository, ensuring it includes:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt` 
   - `README.md`

## Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in with your GitHub account
2. Click "New app"
3. Select your repository, branch (main), and the path to the main file (`app.py`)
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take a few minutes as dependencies are installed)

## Step 3: Configure the App (if needed)

If your app requires specific environment variables or advanced settings:

1. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
2. Add any necessary environment variables
3. Adjust memory requirements if needed

## Step 4: Share Your App

Once deployed, you'll get a public URL for your app (e.g., `https://yourname-accent-analyzer-app.streamlit.app`).

You can share this URL with anyone who needs to access the app.

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails:

1. Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud
2. Verify that all dependencies are correctly listed in `requirements.txt`
3. Make sure there are no errors in your code
4. Ensure your repository is public or properly connected to Streamlit Cloud

## Local Testing Before Deployment

It's recommended to test your app locally before deploying:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will help identify any issues before deployment.

## Maintenance

To update your deployed app:

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy your app with the new changes

## Alternative Deployment Options

If Streamlit Cloud isn't suitable, consider these alternatives:

1. **Heroku**: Good for more complex applications
2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For enterprise-level deployment
3. **Google Cloud Run**: For containerized applications
4. **Railway.app**: Simple deployment with GitHub integration

Each platform has different setup requirements, but the core application code remains the same.
